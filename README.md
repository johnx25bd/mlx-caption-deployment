# Search App, Containerized

## Quickstart

- Copy the four data files from this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16aTFOtnjFngyJLgHIHA8S8n23hF9tItP?usp=drive_link) into the `/api/data` directory.
- Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the services.
- Access the application at `http://localhost:80`.

This repository contains a containerized web application using FastAPI for the backend API, Streamlit for the frontend, and Nginx as a reverse proxy. The application is orchestrated using Docker Compose.

## Architecture

Client Request â†’ Nginx (Port 80) â†’ FastAPI (Port 8000)
â†’ Streamlit (Port 8501)

- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy that routes requests to the appropriate service
- **FastAPI**: Backend API service
- **Streamlit**: Frontend web application

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Python 3.12 (for local development)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the applications:
   - Frontend (Streamlit): `http://localhost/`
   - API (FastAPI): `http://localhost/api/`

## Development

### Local Development Setup

1. Set up Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd api && pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ../streamlit && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run services locally:
   - FastAPI:
     ```bash
     cd api
     uvicorn app.main:app --reload
     ```
   - Streamlit:
     ```bash
     cd streamlit
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

### Docker Commands

- Build containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose build
  ```

- Start services:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

- Stop services:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

## Deployment
